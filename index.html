                    <p>
                        As part of the implementation of a new accounting system, I played a key role in developing reconciliation processes for general 
                        ledger accounts. This required an in-depth understanding of the new system, including how data was stored and retrieved, as well 
                        as the ability to trace the source of transactions as they impacted the general ledger. By mastering the system’s data flow and 
                        structure, I established efficient reconciliation procedures that ensured accuracy and consistency in financial reporting
